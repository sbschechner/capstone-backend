Next Steps:

Create a wire frame of the Client
	//create new expense will have to be a modal that pops up with required fields

	//I want delete and update expense to ask user to select the expense they want to delete
		console.alert(Select the expense you want to update)

	//Assign Expense will also need to ask user to select which expense they want to assign
		Then, will ask with a modal, who do they wany to assign it to ?

			instead of get element by ID, can just use jquery for the button names...

Create a mock API call with data

Then build back end to make API calls actually work 


Maybe call the app - Who Paid
	As in, who paid for what?


Need to bind the data from the modal to the request for the post request -- by doing this, I'll figure out how to do it for put request as well --- to pass to AJAX or just use the form action/ method?

Need to create a post request handler
	Need to put in the wiring for the post request??

Need to create the put request handler

need to create the delete endp
	how do i designed this? 
		like the user wont know 
			the modal would have to drop to the bottom and then it would click
				if .click, it would have to say alert


Will need to put validations on for the post request in terms of numbers and strings using typeOf
