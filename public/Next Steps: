Next Steps:

Create a wire frame of the Client
	//create new expense will have to be a modal that pops up with required fields

	//I want delete and update expense to ask user to select the expense they want to delete
		console.alert(Select the expense you want to update)

	//Assign Expense will also need to ask user to select which expense they want to assign
		Then, will ask with a modal, who do they wany to assign it to ?

		how to use a modal for later:

			instead of get element by ID, can just use jquery for the button names...

Create a mock API call with data

Then build back end to make API calls actually work 


Maybe call the app - Who Paid
	As in, who paid for what?


Need to create the put request handler

need to create the delete endp
	how do i designed this? 
		like the user wont know 
			the modal would have to drop to the bottom and then it would click
				if .click, it would have to say alert

I SHOULD write the end point for delete first and get the test up and running
	Then worry about how to wire the different pieces together
		will use the select feautre and option to pull up all the different possible options
			Then, once the user selects the one to delete, that is the one I will bind to a delete varialbe which i can pass to an AJAX request

Will need to put validations on for the post request in terms of numbers and strings using typeOf
